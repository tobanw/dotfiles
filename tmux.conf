# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's

# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
